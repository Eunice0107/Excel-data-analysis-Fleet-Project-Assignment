**Prepared by:** Eunice Ilunga Tshasuma  
**Date:** April 17, 2025

## Project Overview

This project analyzes fleet equipment data from various departments within a local government. The data was sourced from two Excel worksheets and consolidated into a single, clean dataset. The goal was to uncover insights about vehicle distribution, departmental usage, and equipment trends using Microsoft Excel.

## Objectives

- Clean and consolidate raw vehicle inventory data
- Analyze vehicle distribution by department and equipment class
- Provide summary statistics for decision-making support

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (Text to Columns, Table formatting, PivotTables)
- Manual Data Cleaning
- Reporting in Word/PDF format

## Process

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Split combined values into separate columns
- Removed blank rows and unnecessary white spaces
- Standardized column names and formats
- Corrected spelling errors for clarity and consistency

### 2. Data Analysis
- Used PivotTables to summarize:
  - Total vehicles per department
  - Distribution by vehicle type
- Computed summary statistics such as totals, averages, and counts

### 3. Key Insights
- The **Department of Correction and Rehabilitation** owns the largest fleet.
- **SUVs** and **sedans** are the most common vehicle types.
- **Smaller departments** (e.g., Liquor Control) manage relatively large fleets.
- Public safety equipment is concentrated in specific departments.
